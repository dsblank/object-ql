# pythonish-ql

A Pythonish Query Language, for the [Gramps Project](https://gramps-project.org/) and other systems.

This project is designed to be a drop-in replacement for https://github.com/DavidMStraub/gramps-ql

Rather than having to build, and learn, a new query language, the idea
is to build ontop of Python, the native language of the Gramps Project.

Examples:

```python

```
